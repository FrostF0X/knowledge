### Acceptance tests

Kind of ETE tests that check business requirements and processes, must be automated, because of enormous 
costs and duration associated with manual testing.

Don't miss acceptance with integration tests. This terms has serves for different purpose. You can write either 
acceptance unit and acceptance integration test.   

## Benefits

* Reducing manual testing time spend by testers - the only point humans must check it business logic.
* Regression bugs elimination - every change to software is **safe** and **predictable**. 
* Quick feedback loop (early bug detection) - developers don't have to wait until somebody will check 
if their work is done, they can run all test suite against new software version.
* Specification of business process - all test suites are sufficient and comprehensible 
step by step specification of user stories and business rules.
* Definition of done - test suites are explicit definition for developer when feature is ready. 
It is ready when all tests passes.  

## User stories
User stories has to be created by business analytics, testers, and business.
This user stories become **Given-Then-When** tests.
Implementation of test is filled by programmers and testers.
Finally programmers implement functionality according to this tests.

Good user stories are **testable**
