# Acceptance tests

Kind of ETE tests that check business requirements and processes, must be automated, because of enormous 
costs and duration associated with manual testing.  

## Benefits

* Reducing manual testing time spend by testers - the only point humans must check it business logic.
* Regression bugs elimination - every change to software is **safe** and **predictable**. 
* Quick feedback loop (early bug detection) - developers don't have to wait until somebody will check 
if their work is done, they can run all test suite against new software version.
* Specification of business process - all test suites are sufficient and comprehensible 
step by step specification of user stories and business rules.
* Definition of done - test suites are explicit definition for developer when feature is ready. 
It is ready when all tests passes.
