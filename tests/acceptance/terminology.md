## Paths

**Happy** path - canonical path through application state.
 
**Alternative** path - in large system path that variates a bit from happy in case of starting/ending point
 
**Sad** path - path that is based on inappropriate start state, end state or actions
 
 
## Given-Then-When

Methodology of describing test scenarios, where:

* **Given** - initial system state
* **When** - actions to be taken in this scenario to achieve next state
* **Then** - required next system state
