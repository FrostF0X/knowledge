### Paradigms

Paradigm is briefly determined is way of thinking about the problem.

Starting from early ages of programming there were invented lot of paradigms: 
* imperative - simply allows [side effects](terminology.md#side-effect)
    * [procedural]() - groups code into functions
    * [object-oriented](oop/index.md) - groups code into objects and binds data to operations on this data
    * [structural]() - procedural with restriction of one return point from function and goto statements
* declarative - expresses computation logic without revealing it flow of control
    * [functional]() - restricts modification and usage of global state
    * [logic]() - have different style of execution model depending on language

Additional paradigms that can be used in combination to others like
    * [aspect-oriented]() - increase modularity by allowing the separation of 
    [cross-cutting concerns](terminology.md#cross-cutting-concerns) 
  
  
Almost all paradigms provide some restrictions to building program like
