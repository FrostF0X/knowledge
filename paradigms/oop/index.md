# Object Oriented Programming

Object oriented programming is about objects and communication between them. Have such main concepts as classes, 
class members, class method. Class is may be considered as template for object.

### Properties 
* Binds data to procedures that operate on that data aka encapsulation
* Allows programming by contracts aka polymorphism 
* Code reuse between classes aka inheritance
* Localizing global state into object boundaries

### Peers types in OOP
Peers are objects that are collaborating with current object often called misscalled dependencies.
Pears may be permanent and transient. 
There are 3 main types of pears:
* dependency - object to which some part of behaviour is delegated (permanent)
* notification - object which public methods are invoked which listening to some state change or operation done 
(permanent)
* adjustments - object that are passed to method call, purposed to change execution flow in some way (transient)
