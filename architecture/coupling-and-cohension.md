### Coupling

### Cohesion
defines degree in which concepts used together across codebase. Generally we want things to be very cohesive or not 
cohesive at all. In terms of objects cohesive members are members that are used together in all functions.

To create cohesive units of code:
* When class has to many members it is hard to make them cohesive.
* Create less methods in class - it will help make all members cohesive, in case of 1 method every member is 
cohesive.
* Clarify and extract concepts to make them more cohesive.
* If class cannot make one thing as a whole it is not highly cohesive
